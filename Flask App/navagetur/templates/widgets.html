            <h2>
                <a href="./password.html">
                    Password “Crackability” Widget
                </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Most laypeople who use computers lack an adequate conception of why they are encouraged to use safe
                passwords. This widget aims to put the ease of cracking passwords into context with time estimates of
                how long it would take to crack a given password as well as some example passwords and times to crack.
                This widget provides users with a calculation for how long it would take to brute force crack their
                password based on a low-end estimate for how long it takes their computer to run basic C code. This
                allows users to input a string and check how good of a password it would make.

            <h2>
                <a href="./law_locator.html">
                    Geographical Recording and Data Privacy Law Locator Widget
                </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many individuals are not aware of the privacy or recording consent laws that are applicable to them
                given their residence. We want to empower users to be knowledgeable by creating a widget that simply
                allows users to type in their zip code and will quickly explain the most pertinent privacy/recording
                consent laws within their specified region. The geographical recording and data privacy law locator is
                zip code powered and allows users to input their
                zip code and it then returns the consent laws that are applicable within that region. The user types in
                their zip code and on the back-end the zip code is matched with the corresponding state. The state is
                then searched within our internal categories which are roughly one-party, mixed-party and non-regulated
                state arrays which were sourced from Matthiesen, Wickert & Lehrer, Attorneys of Law Report . We
                increased the functionality to also display more relevant laws, specific to the state.

            <h2>
                <a href="./account_security.html">
                    Personal Account Security Information Widget
                </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many people have trouble keeping track of the security features they have enabled on each of their
                online accounts. This widget allows users to keep track of a variety of account safety features and see
                a representative score for how safe the account is. There are a variety of deterrents to increasing the
                safety of accounts that this widget aims to address. For example, if users have their phone added as a
                multi-factor authentication device and they are in the process of changing their number or have multiple
                phones, the user may not know which devices currently rely on each phone number. This application helps
                to reduce this deterrent by making it easy to add and check the current features of each account. This
                widget allows users to track website name, username, password, the date of last password change,
                whether multi-factor authentication is enabled, whether app passcodes have been generated, associated
                authenticator app devices, associated physical authentication keys, and associated phone numbers. All of
                these fields are entirely optional and are intended to make the user's experience keeping track of their
                account information easier. Once account information is inputted, the program calculates the time it
                would take for the current device to brute force crack the
                password and calculates a safety score based on how many safety features are enabled for each account.
                This widget expands upon the current functionality of password managers to motivate users to further
                increase their online security by reducing their cognitive load when keeping track of and maintaining
                additional security measures.

            <h2>
                <a href="./personal_uniqueness.html">
                    Personal Uniqueness Widget
                </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                It can be difficult for laypeople to understand how easy it can be to re-identify their data. This
                widget contextualizes how easy it is to randomly guess a person based on their inputted characteristics
                in comparison to how easy it would be to pick out a person from everyone in the United States. This
                widget determines how unique someone is by asking them for a list of possible demographic
                characteristics and comparing that person to U.S. Census data.
