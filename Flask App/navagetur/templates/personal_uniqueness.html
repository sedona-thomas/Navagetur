            <h2>Why is this widget important?</h2>
            <p>
                Rich medical, behavioral, and socio-demographic data are key to modern data-driven research, their
                collection and use raise legitimate privacy concerns. Digital citizenship whether that be in the form of
                a LinkedIn or Facebook account has allowed more information than ever before about individuals to be
                readily available online. Re Identification is a term used to describe the process of using existing
                information that may not contain specific names or addresses to accurately identify unique individuals.
                Reidentification normally happens through the merging of datasets and using unique attributes to match
                individuals up. The concern becomes how private is information even when it is anonymized in a data set
                and the answer is challenging. Even heavily sampled anonymized datasets are unlikely to satisfy the
                modern standards for anonymization set forth by GDPR and seriously challenge the technical and legal
                adequacy of the de-identification release-and-forget model.
            </p>

            <h2>What do you learn from this widget?</h2>
            <p>
                It can be difficult for laypeople to understand how easy it can be to re-identify their data. This
                widget contextualizes how easy it is to randomly guess a person based on their inputted characteristics
                in comparison to how easy it would be to pick out a person from everyone in the United States. This
                widget determines how unique someone is by asking them for a list of possible demographic
                characteristics and comparing that person to U.S. Census data.

            <h2>Key Terms</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Reidentification (dba De-anonymization): the practice of matching anonymous data (also known as
                    de-identified data) with publicly available information</li>
                <li>De Identification: Data de-identification is a form of dynamic data masking that refers to breaking
                    the link between data and the individual with whom the data is initially associated. Essentially,
                    this requires removing or transforming personal identifiers.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Data Masking (DDM): is an emerging technology that aims at real-time data masking of
                    production data. DDM changes the data stream so that the data requester does not get access to the
                    sensitive data, while no physical changes to the original production data take place.</li>
